# Detection-of-LBWcases-ML

## Abstract
Low  Birth  weight  (LBW)  acts  as  an  indicator  of  sickness in  newborn  babies.  LBW  is  closely  associated  with  infant mortality  as  well  as  various  health  outcomes  later  in  life. Various  studies  show  strong  correlation  between  maternal health during pregnancy and the childâ€™s birth weight. We  use  health  indicators  of  pregnant  women  such  as  age, height, weight, community etc in  order  to  for  early  detection  of  potential  LBW  cases.  This  detection  is  treated  as  a classification problem between LBW and not-LBW classes
This project presents two machine learning techniques-  K-Nearest  Neighbours(KNN)  and  Artificial  Neural  Networks(ANN)  with  back  propagation (SGD).  It  discusses  the  disadvantages  of KNN  and  overcomes  them  via  ANN.

Both the KNN and Neural Network are coded from scratch using only Numpy arrays.

## Highlights

We use adaptive learning Rate methods (Time Based Decay) for faster convergence
